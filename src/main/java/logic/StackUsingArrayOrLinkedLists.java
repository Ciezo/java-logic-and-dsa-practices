 * Using the FIFO concept. A good practice for understanding the

 * 
 * @todo 
 * - Review the following (again): 
 * 1. FIFO
 *      - First-In and First-Out. It indicates that in a array or list
 *        Whatever element is first to get into stack will also be the last to get out 
 * 2. Stack data structure
 *      - What is popping an element to the stack?
 *      - What is pushing an element to the stack?

/**
 * Question 4:
 * Implement a stack using arrays or linked lists. Include functions for push, pop, and finding the minimum element in O(1) time.
 * 
 * Input: 
 * push(3)
 * push(5)
 * push(2)
 * pop()
 * getMinimum()
 * 
 * Output: 
 * Stack: [3, 5]
 * Minimum: 3
